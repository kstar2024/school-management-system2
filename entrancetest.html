        <h2>Who needs to take an entrance test and when?</h2>

            Entrance testing is the norm and happens in the course of the admissions process. However, students may be exempt if they are coming directly from schools similar to Great Value Academy, such as from another North American accredited school. Students may also be exempt if they have standardized test records with US norms within one school year of their grade preference.

            All non-exempted students in grades 2-12 complete an English and Math admission test. For admittance, applicants typically need to achieve a score in the 50th percentile or above, which is the US norm.
