        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>My previous education is in a different school system (i.e. British, Kenyan, etc.). Will I be able to adjust?</dt>
            <dd>Yes. Great Value Academy is an international school that has experience in welcoming students from many different educational backgrounds. Students who enter Rosslyn from other school systems typically adjust smoothly, both academically and socially.</dd>

            <dt>How is the US school system different from other school systems?</dt>
            <dd>
                In the US system, the teacher is not primarily seen as the one imparting knowledge but rather as the facilitator of learning. The teacher is likely to use several learning techniques, such as working with partners or in small groups, simulations and role-plays, class discussions, learning centers, and other strategies.
                <br><br>
                The assessment system is also different. Rather than working towards one conclusive, comprehensive exam, the US system assesses student learning through smaller exams and projects throughout the course. Students are expected to be prepared for quizzes given at any time. Students are also expected to complete assignments and projects on a regular basis. The emphasis is on internalization and application of the material rather than memorization. The final grade is based on all summative assessments, not only exams.
                <br><br>
                In the American educational ethos, teachers are also very approachable and welcome questions and discussion, both in and out of the classroom setting. This kind of teacher-student interaction might be different from what a student is accustomed to, coming from a different system.
            </dd>

            <dt>What are the average class sizes per grade?</dt>
            <dd>Although we have two or three classes at every grade level from K-12, we keep individual class sizes small to provide an optimal teacher-to-student ratio in every classroom. Kindergarten classes have up to 18 students per classroom. Grades 1-3 have 20 students per class, and grades 4-8 aim for 24 students or fewer per class.
                <br><br>
                High school classes typically range from 15-25 students, but many AP and specialized electives have even smaller class sizes to maximize student-teacher interaction. Our independent study program pairs an advanced student on a tailored project with a single teacher.
            </dd>

            <dt>Is there support for students whose first language is not English?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, we have an excellent English Language Learners (ELL) program for students for whom English is a second or subsequent language, with specialists at different grade levels.</dd>

            <dt>Do you have programs for students with divergent learning needs?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, we have a Learning Support program that serves students who have mild to moderate learning challenges. However, because we have finite resources, spaces in our Learning Support program are limited and we are not always able to admit every student we would like to serve.
                <br><br>
                Individualized Education Plans and testing should be submitted along with the application forms.
                <br><br>
                Great Value Academy, unfortunately, does not have services for children with significant behavioral and emotional challenges or severe learning difficulties.
            </dd>

            <dt>What are Great Value Academy's behavioral expectations?</dt>
            <dd>Great Value Academy has a no-tolerance policy concerning illegal drug, alcohol, and tobacco use on campus. Our students also sign a covenant statement upon admission to Rosslyn that is consistent with our Christian values and educational ethos.</dd>

            <dt>How is Great Value Academy accredited?</dt>
            <dd>Rosslyn is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA) and the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI). The Academy is also affiliated with the Association of International Schools in Africa (AISA).</dd>

            <dt>Does Great Value Academy offer the International Baccalaureate program?</dt>
            <dd>No, Great Value Academy instead offers the more modular Advanced Placement program, which allows students to take college-level classes in subjects where they excel. Most four-year colleges in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and over 60 other countries give students college credit, advanced placement, or both based on their AP Exam scores. This affords our students the opportunity to move into upper-level courses, pursue a double major, and study abroad.
                <br><br>
                We offer a broad range of AP courses, including, among others, Biology, Calculus, Chemistry, English, Economics, French, Psychology, Physics, Studio Art, U.S. History, World History, and European History.
            </dd>

            <dt>Does Great Value Academy offer the SAT or ACT standardized tests?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, we are the testing site for the SAT exam three times per year and the ACT exam twice per year. Registration for the SAT and ACT is done online.</dd>

            <dt>I am a former student of Great Value Academy and want to apply to college. How do I request a transcript?</dt>
            <dd>You may request a transcript by emailing our admissions office, admissions@greatvalueacademy.com.</dd>

            <dt>Does Great Value Academy offer boarding facilities?</dt>
            <dd>Great Value Academy is a day school only. No boarding facilities are available.</dd>
