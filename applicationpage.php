            <h2>Grade Level Entry Age</h2>
            <p>We strongly advocate, for a number of reasons, that students born in August wait until the following year to begin preschool or kindergarten. However, upon request from parents, children whose birthdays fall between August 1 and August 31 may be considered for admission. These students will be admitted only in exceptional circumstances and must demonstrate developmental, social/emotional, and academic readiness, as determined by the admissions committee, in order to be considered for admission after the age deadline. Children whose birthdays fall after August 31 will not be considered or tested for admission.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preschool:</strong> The child must be four years of age by September 1st.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fixed Start Date (cohort 1):</strong> August 1 (or the first day of school in August): for a student who is 4 years old before September 1. (These students may enroll in Kindergarten the subsequent year.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Fixed Start Date (cohort 2):</strong> January 1 (or first day of school in January): for a student whose 4th birthday falls between September 1 - February 1, he/she may start Preschool (afternoon program) on the first day of Semester two of the current year and will also enroll in Preschool the subsequent school year as they do not meet the age requirement for Kindergarten.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Kindergarten:</strong> The child must be five years of age by September 1st.</li>
